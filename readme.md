# Rick and Morty DOM & Fetch Practice

## Intro

This exercise will allow you to practice utilizing Fetch and DOM manipulation.

Rick and Morty is an American science show. This API is rich in information about the show. The API is able to field request to many `id's` through its query params.

## Instructions

### Fetch Data from API and Render Characters

In `script.js`, a `render` function exists. This function takes two parameters: the first character's ID and the second character's ID.

- [ ] Inside the `render` function, target the two `<img>` elements from our HTML
- [ ] Set the `<img>` elements `src` attributes to the image URLs retrieved fom the API
    - To find the image URLs, look through the data in the console

### Styling Characters

- [ ] After rendering the character images, add CSS styles to ensure your page is visually appealing
- [ ] Use CSS to center each image within its container element
- [ ] Apply a border radius to round the corners of each image 
- [ ] Choose a border color of your preference and apply it to the images to distinguish them from the background
- [ ] Test the appearance of the images in the browser and adjust the styles as needed

## Going Further
- Access the characters' name and display it above the pictures
- Give a user the ability to choose the character ID through the use of an input.
- Try and handle all the errors you may encounter
- There are many ways to accomplish the goal of this exercise; see if you can achieve the same result with a different method
